Block09 Persoanal Website Project
------

This project is a personal website. The site will include a home page, about me, portfolio, and a contact page. I'll be filling the site with random images from pexels.com and using Lorem Ipsum for the paragraphs.

Below is a brief breakdown of website

Header with my name and links to the right of the header. Links include home, about me, portfolio, and contact.
Background image is of a laptop, halfway open
Below the background image is my introductory.
I want the home page to be simple and clean, may play with other highlight colors instead of orange, but I think it looks good

Played around with css to configure the placement of div box
Added borders on the headers to seperate them
Inserted generic text to fill up the space
Images are from pexels.com
Had to resize them because they were too far big and caused the site to load slow
Went with highlighting certain words of the headers to add a bit more style and color to the site
